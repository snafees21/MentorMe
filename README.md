# MentorMe

## Introduction
Many students step into college life confused and feel a lack of support in their first year of college and international students need guidance from peers to adjust to this system. 

Students need support in meeting their personal and academic goals from peers they can relate to. 

MentorMe is a platform where college freshman will meet their mentors who will guide them in their first year of college and help them achieve their personal and academic goals. 
Mentors will be elligible through their academic background and picked for a Mentee based on similar interests and major. 

Scroll down to see the UI (this is not a full-working app yet).

This is where new users enter details to confirm they are a student. According to their year of graduation students will be categorized as Mentor or Mentee.
If a student is Freshman/Sophomore they will be determined as Mentee. If they are Junior/Senior they will be Mentors.
