# MentorMe

## Introduction
Many students step into college life confused and feel a lack of support in their first year of college and international students need guidance from peers to adjust to this system. 

Students need support in meeting their personal and academic goals from peers they can relate to. 

MentorMe is a platform where college freshman will meet their mentors who will guide them in their first year of college and help them achieve their personal and academic goals. 
Mentors will be elligible through their academic background and picked for a Mentee based on similar interests and major.
